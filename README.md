Android Instagram (Andgram)
===========================

This is an extremely simple Android Instagram client. It doesn't do much, but
it will let you take pictures and upload them to Instagram. It will also let
you view your activity feed.

No, it won't let you create an Instagram account. No, it really doesn't do
anything else. If you want it to, just leave a comment or shoot me an email.
